Hello and good morning <span role="img" aria-label="smiley face">:~)</span>

I'm back with some of my favorite unreleased Flume tracks

[Flume - Gotta Let Em Go](https://youtu.be/OQnc0y8xSBk)  
[Flume - Ghost feat. Beyonc√©](https://youtu.be/n723j9gl0TY)  
[Flume - Yeah Man](https://youtu.be/mqjA3i4mW9k)  
[Flume - ID](https://youtu.be/SwIOlWmfnDA)

_Gotta Let Em Go_ eventually became _[Depth Charge](https://open.spotify.com/track/20O9K8K0XKUvGooqCW5XN6?si=64257441a94e4b79)_ - but I love the unreleased version with the pitched-down vocals better

_Yeah Man_ eventually became _[Weekend feat. Moses Sumney](https://open.spotify.com/track/1ZjC1bjkwbh7yLemFOEnQ9?si=5fc0b1e92e55470d)_

Unfortunately, the other tracks are still unreleased <span role="img" aria-label="sad face">:~(</span>

These gems originally appeared in [Flume's Essential Mix on BBC Radio 1](https://youtu.be/6DHiYD3BCGY) back in 2015.
It's still one of my favorite mixes of all time so you should totally go check it out

I hope you enjoy some new sounds - thanks for stopping by <span role="img" aria-label="smiley face">:~)</span>
