## About This Site  

I rebuilt this website! Again! This site is a collection of thoughts, memories, and sounds.

## Anaphora?
In the context of linguistics and [Natural Language Processing (NLP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing),
anaphora is the concept of using a word to refer back to a preceding word in an expression, for example:

> I really wanted that matcha! It has the perfect shade of green.

In this example, **it** is an _anaphor_, referring back to **that matcha**.

As this blog is a collection of memories, or references to preceding ideas and experiences,
I thought anaphora was the perfect name.

## Technology
I made this thing with the [Astro](https://astro.build/) web framework.
I chose Astro because it's fast, feels familiar, and uses [server-first rendering](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/why-astro/#server-first).

This blog is powered by a command-line interface, made possible by [inquirer.js](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js).
New posts (like this one) are created by running the `pnpm new` command from the Terminal.
The command runs a custom script that:
1. Creates a new post folder with a [`.mdx`](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/) file that has post metadata like the title, date, and time
2. Opens the file in my preferred code editor, ready for me to type whatever nonsense I want

To add photos, I add image files to the respective post folder and 
reference them in MDX. Images are automatically transformed and optimized, which is very cool.

[Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) automatically deploys the 
site when new changes are pushed to the [project repository](https://github.com/darkhist/qsalas-dev).
